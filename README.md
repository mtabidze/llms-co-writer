## Introduction

The LLMs Co-Writer API is a powerful RESTful service that leverages the prowess of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT, to assist in textual completion, co-writing, and other creative tasks. Built with Python and FastAPI, this application integrates cutting-edge AI, efficient caching via Redis, and reliable storage with DynamoDB.

## Features

- Utilizes OpenAI API for advanced text completions.
- Designed to incorporate additional LLMs in the future.
- Redis-powered caching to enhance speed and efficiency.
- DynamoDB-driven persistence of request and inference data.
- Docker compatibility for easy deployment and scalability.
- Integrated GitHub Actions for automated testing and CI.
